My first project in HTML after a long time without programming.
 I already have some knowledge off HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 2 years of college studying Multimedia.
 I think the foundation part of the curriculum will be easy and will be a refresh of what i already knew.
 Really looking forward to finishing this project.

 PS:Still have to get used to commit and add the files and add coments when necessary.

At the moment I'm working in IT but want to start learning a bit more to progress/swith the path of my carreer. 

Will get back to this readme and updating my thoughts about this whole project :)

Wish me luck!
